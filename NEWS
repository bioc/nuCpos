Parameters (linker length distribution for budding
and fission yeasts) in sysdata.rda were replaced.

The above replacement slightly affect the 
calculation results of predNuCpos and mutNuCpos.
HBA and localHBA will not be affected.

ver. 1.1.5/2019-02-04
Parameters for localHBA in sysdata.rda were renamed.
