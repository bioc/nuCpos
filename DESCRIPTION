Version: 1.24.0
Description: nuCpos, a derivative of NuPoP, is an R package for prediction of nucleosome positions. nuCpos calculates local and whole nucleosomal histone binding affinity (HBA) scores for a given 147-bp sequence. Note: This package was designed to demonstrate the use of chemical maps in prediction. As the parental package NuPoP now provides chemical-map-based prediction, the function for dHMM-based prediction was removed from this package. nuCpos continues to provide functions for HBA calculation.
